# Write a function alphabetical_order that takes one argument: a list of strings that represent film names. It returns a list of the same films in alphabetical order. We have not discussed sorting lists yet, so you should probably search the web to see if there's a good approach out there. Your solution should not be longer than a few lines.

#     You are not allowed to do string-to-string comparisons in this function, so no string_a == string_b!
#     John is not very tidy with his archive, so the captitalization of the names might not be correct. Look into using the lower-function on the given film string.

# John's son Joseph accidentally mixed in some of his own work as lead singer for Toto with a list his dad's compositions. Write a function remove_toto_albums that takes a list of strings, removes Joseph's Toto albums from it and returns the tidy list.

#     It is not certain that all of Joseph's Toto albums are in the list received by remove_toto_albums, but they might! Don't let your script run into any errors.
#     Joseph did not inherit his dad's sloppiness with captitalization, so his Toto albums would be listed correctly.
